The country's political crisis deepened Thursday when Rousseff temporarily resigned as president after Congress voted to begin an impeachment trail against her. Her vice president -- and now arch enemy -- Michel Temer took over as Brazil's president.
Temer wasted no time Thursday listing his top priority: Fixing Brazil's crippled economy.
"Brazil lives today in the worst economic crisis of our history," Temer said Thursday. "It is imperative that we rebuild the fundamentals of Brazilian economy."
He's inheriting an economy that's in its longest recession since the 1930s. Brazil's economy shrank 3.8% last year and its central bank forecasts that it will contract another 3.5% this year. The IMF predicts growth will be slightly negative even in 2017.
